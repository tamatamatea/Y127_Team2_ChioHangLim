# About

Our team has decided to work on heart disease, as heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally and is a genuine cause for concern.
The dataset used will be linked in one of the folders.

# Problem statement

To predict diagnoses based on a patientâ€™s symptoms, and to decide on the suitable treatments to offer the patient.

# Models used
Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine

K Neighbours

Random Forest

# Performance metrics used
ROC AUC

F1 Score

# Conclusion

Range of data while doing outlier removal must be done carefully (if not too much data would be deleted).

Systolic and diastolic are strongly correlated.

Ensembling both models generated a better model for us to use to do prediction (good ratio of correct predictions to total predictions).
